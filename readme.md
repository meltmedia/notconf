# NotConf Website

Hey there fellow developer. Clearly you are here because you code. How do you feel about talking on your code? We are looking for speakers to present at NotConf and we'd love to have you!

## About NotConf
NotConf is an all day, come-and-go pre-conference event for those attending JSConf and for people in the community interested in Javascript. The day before a big conference can be full of excitement as everyone revs up to hear some great speakers. If you arrive in Phoenix on Sunday, April 1st, join us at the Arizona Historical Society at Papago Park.

NotConf is not your typical conference event. Along with insightful speakers and presentations, there will be intimate demos, live music, and ways to collaborate with other JS enthusiasts. There will be plenty of food, drink, and activities to put you in the mood for JSConf the following day. Bring your laptop, your family, or just yourself to enjoy the desert landscape and meet people just as excited about JS as you.

We are so thrilled to host NotConf at the Arizona HIstorical Society. It features a beautiful courtyard with a stunning desert view and an auditorium perfect for our type of pre-conference. This location also boasts the Museum at Papago Park, a collection that chronicles the history of Arizona. This year is Arizona's Centennial Anniversary and the weather in April is just about perfect. It's exciting to see such talented minds gathering here in our great state to discuss the next big steps in Javascript.
